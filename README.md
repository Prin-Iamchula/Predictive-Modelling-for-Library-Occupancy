# Predictive-Modelling-for-Library-Occupancy
This is the dissertation of MSc Data Science at University of Sussex by Prin Iamchula. The purpose is to generate 
the predictive model for forecasting the future occupancy in the library building.


## Introduction
The Library, University of Sussex, would like to understand the patterns of occupancy in the Library building and 
predict the future volume of occupancy to enhance the building management, for instance, increasing more staff on 
service points when the use of Library is the peak, reducing energy consumption from electrical facilities 
when the demand is low, etc. Accordingly, the major goal of this research is to generate the predictive model for 
the future occupancy volume in the Library building. By the contribution of the machine learning techniques, 
time series forecasting algorithms and neuron network system, the research applied the KNN, SVR and Random forest to 
the multivariate model, and the ARIMA, SARIMA, ANN and LSTM to univariate model. 

## Data description
All implementations and analysis in the research experiment mainly utilized Timestamp data, which is transformed into 
hourly and daily time scales. Likewise, weather condition data and term dates period information was applied and fitted 
to both time scales of Timestamp data.
